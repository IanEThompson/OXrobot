#   Noughts and Crosses Game
#   ========================

#   
#   Plays noughts and crosses using a simple machine learning algorithm.
#   
#   The computer starts out completely "dumb"; it plays by the rules but has
#   no clue how to win or lose. (except it can regonise a 'next move win' opportunity).
#
#   But over time, it builds up two "experience" lists, which are essentially
#   lists of "boards" (simplified so equivalent boards are combined), with votes
#   saying whether that board is a good board (led to a win) or a bad board
#   (led to a loss), and makes decisions using that experience.
#
#   After a dozen or so games, it starts to play reasonably smart, and eventually 
#   becomes quite difficult, if not impossible to defeat.
#
#   The board is represented by a string of exactly nine characters.
#   Each character represents a particular position on the board:
#
#       0|1|2
#       -----
#       3|4|5
#       -----
#       6|7|8
#
#   Each character can be "X" or "O" or " " (unoccupied)
#   So the board:
#   
#       X|X|O
#       -----
#       X| |O
#       -----
#       O|X|
#
#   Would be written as: "XXOX OOX "
